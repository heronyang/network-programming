Project #1: Remote Access System (ras).

In this homework, you are asked to design rsh-like access systems,
called remote access systems, including both
client and server.  In this system, the server designates a directory,
say ras/; then, clients can only run executable programs inside the
directory, ras/.

The following is a scenario of using the system.

csh> telnet myserver.nctu.edu.tw 7000 # the server port number
**************************************************************
** Welcome to the information server, myserver.nctu.edu.tw. **
**************************************************************
** You are in the directory, /home/studentA/ras/.
** This directory will be under "/", in this system.
** This directory includes the following executable programs.
**
**	bin/
**	test.html	(test file)
**
** The directory bin/ includes:
**	cat
**	ls
**	removetag		(Remove HTML tags.)
**	removetag0		(Remove HTML tags with error message.)
**	number  		(Add a number in each line.)
**
** In addition, the following two commands are supported by ras.
**	setenv
**	printenv
**
% printenv PATH                       # Initial PATH is bin/ and ./
PATH=bin:.
% setenv PATH bin                     # Set to bin/ only
% printenv PATH
PATH=bin
% ls
bin/		test.html
% ls bin
ls		cat		removetag     removetag0    number
% cat test.html > test1.txt
% cat test1.txt
<!test.html>

Requirements and Hints:

1. All data to stdout and stderr from server programs return to
clients.

2. The remote directory in the server at least needs to include
"removetag" and "number" and a test html file.

3. The programs removetag and number are not important in this project.
TAs will provide you with these two programs.

4. You MUST use "exec" to run "ls", etc.  You MUST NOT use functions
   like "system()" or some other functions (in lib) to do the job.
   That is, you cannot use a function which will include "exec".

5. Pipe "|" behave the same as that in Unix shell. However, pipe "|n"
   pipes the stdout S1 to the stdin S2 of the n'th next legal process.

6. For commands that are empty or have errors, the pipe to the command is closed
   subsequently.

Additional comments:

1. All arguments MUST NOT INCLUDE "/" for security.
   You should print out error message instead.

2. You can still let stderr be the console output for your debugging messages.

3. In addition to demo, you also need to prepare a simple report.

If you find some commands confusing or not working, please let me
know. Thanks.
